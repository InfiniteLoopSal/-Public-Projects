# -Public-Projects
A gallery of projects created with: ToolBook; MS Physics; launcher, utility, tool QML; complete Python or C++ projects

Welcome to my collection of public projects.  
This space showcases the best of my work as a developer, UI designer, 3D modeler, and digital craftsman.

## 🔧 What you’ll find here
• Applications and tools built with **Python**, **C++**, **QML/Qt Design Studio**, **JavaFX**, and **C# (WinForms/WPF)**  
• Restored or modernized legacy projects such as **ToolBook‑Revival**  
• Utilities, launchers, scripts, and small tools created to simplify everyday workflows  
• UI components, interface experiments, and design showcases  
• Educational or demonstrative projects

## 🎮 3D & Simulation
Some projects include:
• 3D models created in **SketchUp**  
• Physics-based simulations using **MSPhysics**  
• Small games and experiments built with **Ruby + MSPhysics**

## 🧰 My philosophy
I believe in software that is:
• useful  
• elegant  
• secure  
• sustainable  
• crafted with care and intention  

Every project here is a piece of my journey — an experiment, a restoration, or an idea brought to life.
